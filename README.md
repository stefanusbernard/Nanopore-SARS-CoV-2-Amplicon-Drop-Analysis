# Oxford Nanopore SARS-CoV-2 Amplicon Drop Analysis
### Following the NGS processing using WF-ARTIC workflow by EPI2ME-LABS, we observed amplicon drop in few regions in a number of SARS-CoV-2 cases detected. This repository contains the codes for ARTIC/Midnight Oxford Nanopore SARS-CoV-2 NGS Amplicon Drop analysis.

## Required input file :
- VCF file generated by WF-ARTIC or EPI2ME-LABS, header of VCF should be removed (via script or manually is fine) prior to analysis
- artic_ncov primer bed file, converted to .csv (available in this repo is ARTIC V3)
- midnight_ncov primer bed file, converted to .csv (available in this repo is ARTIC V3)
- both artic and midnight primer bed can be obtained from https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V3 ,kindly select your preferred kit (here i am using V3)

## Output:
- .txt file consisting the detected mutations in a position inside primer binding region
- .excel file similar to SnpSift output, in addition with PRIMER name and Alternative PRIMER name
